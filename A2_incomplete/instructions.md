The goal of this assignment is to build a data ingestion pipeline similar to the one built in class using Python.

    Find a data source with an API similar to the one we used in class (COVID-19 cases in Ontario).
    Describe briefly the data source
    Illustrate how to prepare a GET request to pull the data.
    What parameters do you need to provide?
    What type of authentication do you need to use?
    Write a function to request the data
    Illustrate your Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering processes
    Ingest the data into your own database in our Microsoft SQL Server
    Format: Share your code in a python (.py) or jupyter notebook file (.ipynb)
